# The Personhood of Kermit: Towards a Metaphysics of Hyperreality
> "In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was Green" John 1:1 from the Gospel According to Kermit

That is not actually how that quote from the Bible goes, of course.  There is no Gospel According to Kermit, but there *could* be.

This is my exploration of a question - ***How does narrative/story shape reality?*** - and the threads that keep entangling together as I search across fields and disciplines to find the answer to that question.

I did not at first know that was the question I was exploring.  Only figured that out in retrospect after decades of wandering through various fields of knowledge and [[Ways of Knowing\|Ways of Knowing]].
