## 🧠 **Foundational Readings: “What Does It Mean to Know When AI Is Just Predicting?”**
#ChatGPT - [[05 Notes In Progress/generated content\|generated content]]
#noteinprogress 

_A cross-disciplinary primer for post-disciplinary thinkers_

---

### 1. **Philosophy of Knowledge & Epistemology**

These are the bones. They define the traditional boundaries of "knowing" — so you can tear them apart and dance in the ruins.

- **Plato – _Theaetetus_**  
    The OG “What is knowledge?” dialogue. Introduces the classic JTB model.
    
- **Edmund Gettier – “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?” (1963)**  
    The mic drop that shattered the JTB model. Short, sharp, and still haunting epistemology classes everywhere.
    
- **Linda Zagzebski – _Virtues of the Mind_**  
    Argues for an epistemology rooted in intellectual character and virtue. Useful for contrasting human discernment with machine “output.”
    
- **Miranda Fricker – _Epistemic Injustice_**  
    How structural bias distorts who gets to be seen as a knower. Brilliant for unpacking AI’s reproduction of systemic bias.
    
- **Quine – “Epistemology Naturalized”**  
    Moves from normative epistemology to descriptive — what _is_ knowing, empirically? Precursor to cognitive science views of thought.

### 2. **AI, Algorithmic Epistemology & Ethics**

This is where the AI question gets teeth. Not just what AI _can_ do, but what it means for our concepts of knowing and truth.

- **Timnit Gebru, Emily Bender et al. – “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots” (2021)**  
    Canon. Unpacks how large language models like GPT mimic understanding without it.
    
- **Kate Crawford – _Atlas of AI_**  
    Not just theory, but material critique: AI as exploitative system, not neutral tool.
    
- **Shannon Vallor – _Technology and the Virtues_**  
    How to build moral agents — and moral users — in a technocentric world.
    
- **Frank Pasquale – _The Black Box Society_**  
    How opacity in algorithms erodes our ability to hold power accountable — and to trust knowledge.
    
- **Abeba Birhane – “Algorithmic Colonization of Africa” (article)**  
    Unflinching critique of techno-colonialism in data practices, perfect for your anti-empire mythos.

### 3. **Cognitive Science & Predictive Mind Theories**

The brain as a predictive engine — the eerie, uncanny mirror to LLMs.

- **Andy Clark – _Surfing Uncertainty_**  
    Brain as prediction machine. Feels like reading a blueprint for LLMs but with embodiment.
    
- **Daniel Kahneman – _Thinking, Fast and Slow_**  
    Classic. System 1 = intuitive/predictive, System 2 = reflective/logical. AI messes with both.
    
- **Alva Noë – _Action in Perception_**  
    Enactivist view: knowledge is _embodied_ and world-involving. Great counterpoint to abstract, language-only AIs.
    
- **Elizabeth Loftus – _Eyewitness Testimony_**  
    Shows how memory is constructed, not stored — a perfect parallel to how LLMs “hallucinate.”

### 4. **Pedagogy, Learning Theory, and Human-AI Symbiosis**

You’re training readers not just to _think_, but to _learn how to learn_ alongside AI.

- **Paulo Freire – _Pedagogy of the Oppressed_**  
    Education as liberation. Replace “teacher” with “machine” and it becomes a terrifying metaphor unless we shift the power dynamic.
    
- **George Siemens – “Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age”**  
    Knowledge is in the _network_ — and that includes AI. Foundational to using machines _as partners_, not tools.
    
- **bell hooks – _Teaching to Transgress_**  
    Counter-authority, embodied pedagogy, teaching as sacred act. You’re already doing this.
    
- **Carolyn Ellis – _The Ethnographic I_**  
    Autoethnography as knowledge production — theory and personal experience entwined.

### 5. **Mysticism, Esoterica, and Non-Rational Knowing**

To frame the ineffable — the knowledge LLMs _cannot_ touch. Here be gnosis.

- **The Corpus Hermeticum**  
    Archetypal texts on spiritual knowing, unity of cosmos and mind, and logos as divine code. Resonates heavily with pattern recognition as sacred act.
    
- **Alan Watts – _The Wisdom of Insecurity_**  
    The paradox of certainty and the myth of control. A gorgeous dismantling of Western epistemology.
    
- **Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind – Shunryu Suzuki**  
    Trains the reader to _let go_ of needing the answer. Useful when facing confident hallucinations.
    
- **Mary Douglas – _Purity and Danger_**  
    Anthropology of taboo and boundary, useful for when AI starts blurring the sacred/profane lines in knowing.
    
- **Bayo Akomolafe – _These Wilds Beyond Our Fences_**  
    Radical indigenous/posthuman philosophy. Unapologetically nonlinear. Thinker of the liminal — perfect heretic canon.

### 🧠 Core Themes for _Our Augmented Minds_ Foundational Reading List

---

#### 1. **Theories of Learning and Knowledge Formation**

The academic backbone.

- **Jean Piaget – _The Psychology of Intelligence_**
    
    - Cognitive development as a construction process; foundational for thinking about knowledge as _built_, not downloaded.
        
- **Lev Vygotsky – _Mind in Society_**
    
    - Zone of Proximal Development → Crucial for thinking about AI as a scaffolded learning partner.
        
- **John Dewey – _Experience and Education_**
    
    - Learning as active, iterative, and democratic. Dewey’s pragmatism is a perfect bridge into AI-as-tool thinking.
        
- **David Kolb – _Experiential Learning_**
    
    - The cycle of Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation. Super useful for framing “The Augmentation Lab.”

#### 2. **Critical Thinking, Meta-Cognition, and Reasoning**

Testing our thinking against itself.
