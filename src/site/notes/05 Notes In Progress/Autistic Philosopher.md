I am an Autistic Philosopher. Not a Philosopher of Autism - that particular field would fit somewhere between Philosophy of Disability and Philosophy of Consciousness. I say "Autistic Philosopher" to indicate that the nature of my Autistic mind GREATLY influences how I do Philosophy. It cannot be separated from it.
