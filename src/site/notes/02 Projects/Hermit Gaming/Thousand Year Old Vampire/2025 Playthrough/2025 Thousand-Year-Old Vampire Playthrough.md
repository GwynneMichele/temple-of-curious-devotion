**Vampire Name:** Domitia Sabina Philomathes
Birth year: 176 CE
Origin:  Alexandria, Egypt
Background:  Domitia comes from a modest noble family in Rome.  She was sold as an adolescent bride to a wealthy Roman administrator bound for Alexandria who mostly ignored her except when he forced himself on her until he died of old age while she was in her 20s, leaving her free to live her life.  She's a patroness of the Library of Alexandria and often disguises herself as a man so she can gain access herself.
