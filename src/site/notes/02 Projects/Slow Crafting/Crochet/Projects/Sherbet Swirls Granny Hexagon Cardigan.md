Hook size: 5.0mm/H

I'm not using a pattern for this one, the technique is all over the internet.  Start with a magic ring, do 6 granny clusters, join the round, increase 6 corners per round until it's the size you want it to be, then repeat for the other side.  This is my first time making one of these, so I'm going with a basic execution of it, and future iterations I'll explore adding decorative panels to it.

Round 1:

I did 21 rounds on each of the two hexagon panels to get to the necessary sleeve size, then seamed the sleeves at the shoulders.  Then I added five more rows to the body before seaming at the back.

For the sleeves, I've decided to do single crochet rounds to do a rapid decrease in order to create a puffy effect, and then I'll be doing a long faux-ribbed cuff with thumb holes.
