# Temple of Curious Devotion

*This is the center of the labyrinth.  All paths return here.*

# Start Here

Welcome, wanderer. This is a [[05 Research & Zettelkasten/Hypermap\|Hypermap]] of my mind, a [[05 Research & Zettelkasten/Second Brains\|Second Brain]] even.

It's a public Obsidian vault of entangled ideas, speculative theology, philosophical heresies, digital pedagogy, and research-in-progress.

This vault is part of the larger project known as the **Order of Paradox**. You can visit the main site here:

## What This Vault *Is*

This is a **digital garden**, not a blog. These are **living notes**, not finished essays.

Youâ€™ll find:
- Notes for my upcoming independent thesis project: *All religions are fan fiction*
- Research trails about hyperreal religions, mythopoetics, and algorithmic gods
- Seeds for future essays, courses, and game design
- Fragments of philosophical autotheory
- Maps of my obsessions

Everything here is in progress. Some notes are stubs. Some are dense. Many are contradictory on purpose.

## How to Explore

Thereâ€™s no single path. Start wherever your curiosity catches.

I recommend:
- Checking the [[Index\|Index]] page (coming soon)
- Using backlinks + tags to fall deeper into ideas
- Visiting the [Topics](https://orderofparadox.neocities.org/topics) page on my Neocities site for curated entry points

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This

Because learning in public is sacred.  
Because hypertext is a magical medium.  
Because gods are stories.  
Because I want you to see the wires in my mind.
