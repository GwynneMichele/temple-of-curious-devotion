I actually undertook my first "personal curriculum" starting in late 2022/early 2023 when I used ChatGPT to create a self-study curriculum that would mimic a university education.  I'd reached a point in my business and life where I could basically just devote all my time to learning and sharing what I learned, and I dove in.

Then I got the chance to go back to college and resumed my philosophy degree in January 2024 - I'll graduate in 2026.

I have been *loving* the "personal curriculum" trend lately - it's so good to see so many people devoting themselves to their personal education.

My personal curriculum right now is taking advantage of the free access to Google certificates that I get through my university, as well as continuing to improve my lacemaking skills in knitting, crochet, and tatting.  I also want to get more reading in, and focus on improving my creative writing skills and discipline so I can finally finish some fiction.  And there's also my ongoing language studies - I started learning Chinese in 2023 and I'm also in a Spanish class in school for gen ed requirements.
