Ari stalked back to the residential hall where her suite was located.

The Abbess Prime had confirmed that Sylvie was indeed her new roommate, as she felt they'd be able to help each other in their studies.

Ari had argued that she didn't need help, but when the rug at her feet had started to ice over, she lost the argument.

"Sylvie is Winterborn with exquisite control of her abilities," the Abbess Prime had told her.  "You will do well to be in her presence so that you can learn from her.  And she could definitely benefit from some of your more creative ways of working with the ice.  Her control makes her more rigid than is generally helpful.  I wouldn't put you together if I didn't think it wouldn't benefit the both of you.  You'll be fine."

Ari didn't want to be fine.

She wanted to be alone to practice visiting the Threads.

She approached the door to her room and took a deep breath before entering.  She knew that being a member of The Abbey of Four Seasons came with a commitment to obey the orders of the Abbess.  Even when one was unhappy with those orders.  The only exception being illegal orders, but much to Ari's annoyance, a new roommate was completely expected for most.  She'd only been able to go without because The Winter Abbey never attracted many novices.

Ari stared at Sylvie in shock.  "What do you mean?" she said.  "You're not buying into that nonsense are you?  It's followed me my whole life."

"I know," Sylvie said.  "That's why I'm here to warn you.  I know you lost your dad to the cult, and you need to know the cult has penetrated the highest levels of authority.  They believe in the prophecy, and they believe it's about you."

Ari spat on ground at the mention of her father.  "I didn't lose him to the cult.  He's the fucking leader of it."

Sylvie stared at her, stunned.

"I'm not the World Weaver, Sylvie," Ari said.  "You have to convince them I'm not the World Weaver."

"I've tried, Ari," Sylvie said.  "I've tried.  But they want you gone."

"What do you mean they want me gone?"

"Dead, Ari.  They want you dead."

Ari was stunned.  She didn't know what to think.  She had done everything they'd asked her to do.  Sure, she'd been practicing visiting the Threads for years, but she'd always been so careful.  There was no way they could suspect what she was doing, let alone be so certain of it that it would warrant her death.  She hadn't even made any unsanctioned changes to the Threads.  She was still looking for the right one.

Ari invited Sylvie into her home, pointing to the table near her loom.

"How do you know my name?" Sylvie said to her.

"I have known you for many years, Sylvie," Ari said.  "You just don't remember it.  Yet."

Sylvie's eyes widened.  "So you'll help me change my fate?" she asked.

Ari nodded.  "I already have," she responded, handing Sylvie a cup of the tea.  "You just have to accept it.  Sit here, sip this tea, have some of the cookies," Ari pointed to a plate on the table, "and when you step through that door again, you'll find yourself faced with making a different choice than one you already made, with the opportunity to live your life again in a new way."

Sylvie wasn't sure what to believe.  But she knew what decision she wanted to change.  One made decades ago, before the War came, before everything went so very wrong.
