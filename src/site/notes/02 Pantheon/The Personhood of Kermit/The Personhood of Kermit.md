# The Personhood of Kermit: Towards a Metaphysics of Hyperreality
> "In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was Green" John 1:1 from the Gospel According to Kermit

That is not actually how that quote from the Bible goes, of course.  There is no Gospel According to Kermit, but there *could* be.

This is my exploration of a question - ***How does narrative/story shape reality?*** - and the threads that keep entangling together as I search across fields and disciplines to find the answer to that question.

I did not at first know that was the question I was exploring.  Only figured that out in retrospect after decades of wandering through various fields of knowledge and [[Ways of Knowing\|Ways of Knowing]].

This - The Personhood of Kermit - is a story and a journey.

In part, it's a story of how I got here to writing about a felt frog as an entryway to a whole different way of thinking about "reality" than most people are used to.

In part, it's a journey to continue those threads of my life, of the writings of others, and how those intersect and evolve into new ideas that shape how I perceive "reality".

It starts with [[Discordianism\|Discordianism]] and [[Chaos Magic\|Chaos Magic]] which I discovered in my early 20s after stumbling into the Church of All Worlds after reading Heinlein.  That opened up a whole new world of "made up religion" for me..

So I made up a goddess.

Because I'd never in my life felt a connection to anything spiritual even though religion FASCINATED me.
