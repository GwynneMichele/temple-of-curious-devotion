#heresy
I love religion.

I love them so much, it's been my special interest of independent study and exploration for decades now.

In that time, I've come to the conclusion that all religions are fandoms, and I've developed a theology that views [[05 Research & Zettelkasten/Gods as Algorithms\|Gods as Algorithms]] running through myth and dogma, and this does not diminish their power, but instead inverts the power structure that puts gods as our creators and instead, makes them our creations - and makes them programmable.

If you've ever seen fandom wars, you have a deeper insight into religious wars than you might realize.

This note will be a launchpad for my explorations of this topic.

The roots of this thread reside in my long winding explorations of religion and mysticism over the years, and sprouted when I studied Jediism as a modern religion in Anthropology of Religion where we got to pick our own topic and I LOVED IT.  That's where I learned about [[Hyperreal Religions\|Hyperreal Religions]], started diving into hyperreality, and connecting it backwards to my own experimentations with Discordianism and Chaos Magic that led me to create my own goddess who later named herself Paradox and started gathering followers without consulting me because gods are memes that develop a will of their own.
