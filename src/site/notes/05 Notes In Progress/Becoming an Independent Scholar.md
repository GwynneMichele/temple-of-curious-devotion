Researcher vs Scholar - I'm a scholar.  I don't want to do research that directly involves humans.  I want to do literature reviews, critical reads, and cross-disciplinary synthesis of ideas, and mostly, I want to publish on my own through Substack, my [[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]], and other avenues of independent publishing.

That doesn't mean I don't do research/experimentation, but I'm my only subject, and my experiments are all in self-inflicted head games and figuring out how social media algorithms work so I can create an effective content plan for growth.
