# Temple of Curious Devotion

*This is the center of the labyrinth.  All paths return here.*
#noteinprogress 
# Start Here

Hello there!

I'm Gwynne, The Curious Hermit.

I'm a [[05 Notes In Progress/Queer Heretic Nun\|Queer Heretic Nun]], [[Contemplative Sorceress\|Contemplative Sorceress]], [[Philosopher of Emergent Gods\|Philosopher of Emergent Gods]], and Abbess Founder of [[The Order of Paradox\|The Order of Paradox]].

This [[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] that I call [[The Temple of Curious Devotion\|The Temple of Curious Devotion]] is my [[05 Notes In Progress/Second Brains\|Second Brain]].  It's built on [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) and uses the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin to push selected notes to a vercel static site where you are reading this right now.

This is an evolving Obsidian Vault.  I started it Summer 2025 while I was on summer break between my junior and senior year of college - my midlife crisis sent me back to college at 45, and I'll be 47 next month, and graduating with a bachelor's in philosophy in 2026 - 30 years after I graduated from high school.

I take a LOT of notes about a lot of stuff.  I've got a lot of random ideas I'm exploring.  Sometimes they become articles.  Sometimes they'll become something else.  Other times, this just sit there, unfinished, waiting for me to maybe return to them, or for them to spark someone else to continue the train of thought in their own way.

I'll be sharing selected notes publicly.  Not all my notes are for public consumption.  For instance, I won't share notes for school until after the semester is done and over with because I don't want the plagiarism checkers to pick those up in their web search to check for plagiarism.

My curiosity wanders through a variety of disciplines, but I'm primarily interested in how narrative shapes our reality, both individually and collectively.  I use AI to design a lot of self-study plans for me, going only as deep into a topic as my interest wants me to, usually right when something clicks in my head with big connections to a bunch of other things.  [[05 Notes In Progress/My AI Workflow\|My AI Workflow]] is a note in progress, always at mercy of a rewrite as I continually adjust my workflow to use AI to accelerate - not replace - my learning.

You're welcome to follow the links around, and find me on Threads where I go by [@gwynnem](https://www.threads.com/@gwynnem) if you want to converse sometime!

## What This Vault *Is*

This is a digital garden.  Notes often trail off.  Some are AI-generated placeholders that will get replaced with my own notes when I revisit those topics - AI-generated content will be marked as such, all other content in my notes is straight from my brain through my fingers and keyboard, and transmitted to you through high-speed internet connections and data servers that neither of us control.

Youâ€™ll find:
- Notes for my upcoming independent thesis project: [[02 Projects/The Personhood of Kermit/The Personhood of Kermit\|The Personhood of Kermit]]
- Research trails about hyperreal religions, mythopoetics, and algorithmic gods
- Seeds for future essays, courses, and game design
- Fragments of philosophical autotheory
- Maps of my obsessions

Everything here is in progress.  Some notes are stubs. Some are dense.  Many are contradictory on purpose.

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This

Because learning in public is sacred.  
Because hypertext is a magical medium.  
Because gods are stories.  
Because I want you to see the wires in my mind.
