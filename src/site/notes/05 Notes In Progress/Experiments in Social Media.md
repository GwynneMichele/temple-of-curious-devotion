For years, I've been conducting casual experiments on various social media platforms.  Just a bit of posting strategy, observing what happens, and adjusting the strategy as I go.

I observe both what the algorithms push, and how people react to what the algorithm has pushed to them through my own posts.  Threads has a ragebait algorithm.  Facebook is going through an algorithmic midlife crisis trying to figure itself out again.  Fuck Twitter.  TikTok's algorithm I observe only as a consumer.  And Farcaster's algorithm is a new kid trying to figure out what role it wants to play on the playground.

The plan for this note is to start documenting some of my experiments and the results of those experiments so others can perhaps learn from what I've learned.
