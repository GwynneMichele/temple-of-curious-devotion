# Hypermap

This vault is a **Hypermap of my mind**.

Not a map *of* a territory, but a map of the connections between ideas that bounce around in my mind.

It's one of the ways that I augment my mind - my newsletter [[02 Pantheon/Our Augmented Minds\|Our Augmented Minds]] is all about exploring that.  [[04 Relic Archive/Drafts/Your Mind Doesn't Stop At Your Skull\|Your Mind Doesn't Stop At Your Skull]] - it extends not just into the body, but beyond it.  Losing a notebook feels like losing a part of yourself because our brains are so adept at using our environment to extend and augment our minds.

I get an idea, I make a note, I start to write my thoughts about the idea, then I head off to other tools to dig into the idea.  Google searches, chats with bots, and deep dives into the University Library archives and databases.  [Jstor] is my bestie.

One of the tangents I'm exploring is [[Meme Economics\|Meme Economics]] and the [[Attention Economy\|Attention Economy]] - how Capitalism seems to be morphing before our eyes from a system built on the exploitation of physical and mental labor to generate value to one that is built on the exploitation of our attention through algorithms as both consumers and creators.  It's not an urgent topic of interest for me, but I know I need to get a baseline in economic theory that I don't currently have, so I turn to [[05 Research & Zettelkasten/Crash Course Economics\|Crash Course Economics]], watch the videos at my own pace, making brief notes as I go that might later connect to something else.

All those links in the above paragraphs show up as nodes in the Graph view of this Obsidian vault.  One idea connecting to another and another and another.  

This public view is actually only a tiny portion of the hypermap of my mind residing across multiple Obsidian vaults, some Notion databases, and decades worth of handwritten notebooks.

## What is a Hypermap?

A **Hypermap** is more than a mind map. It’s a nonlinear, interlinked, living cartography of thought.  
It's part garden, part archive, part dream-logic directory.

A Hypermap is:

- **Interconnected**: ideas are linked, not siloed
- **Recursive**: some notes point back to themselves or spiral deeper
- **Messy**: this is not a polished book—it’s a codex in flux
- **Personal**: this map is built in public, but for private ends
- **Speculative**: it doesn't just document ideas—it makes them

I use the word "Hypermap" to signal both **hypertext** and **[[hyperreality\|hyperreality]]**—two core themes of my research and life.

## What’s in this Map?

You’ll find:

- Notes from my research into *[[hyperreal religion\|hyperreal religion]]*, *[[mythopoetics\|mythopoetics]]*, *[[gods as algorithms\|gods as algorithms]]*, and more
- Fragments of philosophical autotheory
- Oblique entry points into courses I’m writing, games I’m building, and ideas I’m testing
- Connections that don’t follow standard logic, but **emergent narrative gravity**

## Why Map Like This?

Because traditional knowledge systems are too linear.  
Because my brain isn't a library - it’s a **cathedral of tangled string**.  
Because learning in public is a kind of sacred exposure.  
Because the act of mapping is itself **magical**.
