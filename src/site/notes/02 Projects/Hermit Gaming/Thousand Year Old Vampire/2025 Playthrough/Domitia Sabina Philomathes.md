**Vampire Name:** Domitia Sabina Philomathes
Birth year: 176 CE
Origin:  Alexandria, Egypt
Background:  Domitia comes from a modest noble family in Rome.  She was sold as an adolescent bride to a wealthy Roman administrator bound for Alexandria who mostly ignored her except when he forced himself on her until he died of old age while she was in her 20s, leaving her free to live her life.  She's a patroness of the Library of Alexandria and often disguises herself as a man so she can gain access herself.

## Memory 4
### Experience 1
I finally birthed a son.  Maybe now my husband will let me be.  His shriveled dick barely functions anyway.

### Experience 2
The hunger was like nothing I'd ever felt before.  Marcus came to me in the night, crying with bad dreams, and the next thing I remember, I was holding his limp body, my hunger abated.
### Experience 3
Lucilla was always a perceptive child.  She looked upon me with suspicion after the death of her younger brother who she'd been closer to than anyone else.  It broke my heart to drain her, but the bloodthirst won out over the love I had for her.

## Memory 5
### Experience 1
For weeks, it seemed like someone was following me as I made my way through the dark of night to the chambers of the secret room where the mystery priestesses gathered.  Before he sank his teeth into my neck, he said he could smell my hunger for knowledge and was granting me immortality to satiate it, at the cost of a hunger for blood.  He called himself Neb-Atem and said he'd seen the building of the pyramids.

# Narrative
I am Domitia Sabina Philomathes.  I was born in Rome and at the age of 12, my father sold me to a decrepit Roman official in order to settle his debts.  I was taken to Alexandria where my husband was sent to administrate the grain shipments back to Rome.  

At 14, I gave birth to my first daughter, Claudia, and Lucilla was born three years later.  Another four years, and my son Marcus was born.  I was grateful - my husband wanted a male heir, and left me alone after that.  He died when Marcus was 2, leaving me a widow.

I was inducted into a mystery school that gathered under the Serapeum at night and it was only after the final rite of induction that I learned the nature of the Living God that the priestesses worshipped.  He'd stalked me for weeks before turning me - a gift of immortality at the cost of blood.

I'd never known hunger like that before.  That first night, in a frenzy, I drained my dear son Marcus, finding his lifeless body when my mind returned from the feral blood frenzy induced by that hunger.  I mourned, but the loss of children was not unusual.  Easy enough to pass off as sickness, and with no other male heirs, the estate came to me. (Roll 1, Prompt 1)

Lucilla had always been close to Marcus.  She was a perceptive child, and showed signs of being gifted with the _Sight_ at an early age.  She came to me one night, screaming that she knew I'd killed Marcus.  That she'd seen the monster that I'd become.  I tried to reason with her, but as she came closer and closer to me in her anger, all I could smell was the blood, and that raging hunger took me again.  My mind leaves, I become nothing but the monster she said I was, and once again, I came back to myself holding the limp body of one of my children in my arms. (Roll 2, Prompt 5)
