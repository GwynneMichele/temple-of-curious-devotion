**Human Creativity vs Bot Creativity** - human creativity comes from the unique mixing of ideas that occurs within a person not just with the thoughts bouncing around their brain, but also all the various environmental stimuli coming at them.  I put on an old familiar show in the background while I'm working on something else, and ideas that come from the connections that spark in my mind can't be replicated by a bot that can't have the human experience of curating an environment to increase creativity.
